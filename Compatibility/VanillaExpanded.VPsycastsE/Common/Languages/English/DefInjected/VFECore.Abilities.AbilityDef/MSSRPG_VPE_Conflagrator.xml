    <VPE_QuenchFlames.description>Transmute the air around a blaze directly into a flame supressing foam. This transmutation is tricky on a small scale so the radius is quite impressive.</VPE_QuenchFlames.description>
    <VPE_FireBeam.description>Attempts to recreate the power of a star inside a concentrated column of almost liquidized oxygen. The resulting emission of plasma is so powerful that only the most accomplished mages can hope to compare.
