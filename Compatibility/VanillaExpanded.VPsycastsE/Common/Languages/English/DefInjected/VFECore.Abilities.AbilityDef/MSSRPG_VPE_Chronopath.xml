    <VPE_SeasonTimeskip.description>One of the forbidden magics, known only to a few masters. Magically suspends the entire planet, effectively skipping forward a season nigh instantaneously, very strenuous and puts the caster in a coma.</VPE_SeasonTimeskip.description>
    <VPE_TimeSphere.description>Creates a time bubble which compresses the flow of time in an area. Rapidly ages living creatures, plants flourish and wither, and structures start to disintegrate from the bizarre stress.</VPE_TimeSphere.description>
    <VPE_Timequake.description>Find a discontinuity in the ambient mana field and compress it, releasing a massive temporal disturbance. Every creature in range but outside of the safe inner circle will experience rapid aging and structures will warp. Casting this takes 20 seconds of meditation, and afterwards, the caster will go into a five-day arcane overload coma. The disturbing timequake echoes will inflict pain on everyone for many kilometers around, causing diplomatic consequences with all factions.</VPE_Timequake.description>
