    <VPE_Liferot.description>Magically induces randomized mass necrosis in a target, exposing the afflicted body parts to infection and intense gagging due to the smell. Duration scales with the target’s magical aptitude and is an obviously overtly hostile action.</VPE_Liferot.description>
    <VPE_ParalysisPulse.description>Emits a cloud of black particles around the caster, which afflicts all those within the area - except the caster - with 2 hours of paralytic abasia. The radius scales with the caster’s magical aptitude.</VPE_ParalysisPulse.description>
    <VPE_Ghostwalk.description>Magically disolves the body into pure mana essence making the caster ethereal and able to pass through structures. The duration the caster is able to hold this transformation scales with the caster’s magical aptitude.</VPE_Ghostwalk.description>
    <VPE_ConsumeBodies.description>Magically strips all remaining life force from nearby humanoid corpses and stores the essence as a permanent stacking buffer to arcane load.</VPE_ConsumeBodies.description>
    <VPE_Enthrall.description>Magically strips the deceased target’s life force and infuses it directly into their bones, animating them for a full day. The only remaining instinct is to inflict pain on the caster’s enemies.</VPE_Enthrall.description>
    <VPE_Resurrect.description>By sacrificing a natural finger, the caster is able to transfer their own life energy into a humanlike target, repairing broken-down tissues and kickstarting the body back to life. The target will be incapacitated and their allegiances will remain the same. The less preserved the body is, the more likely the target is to suffer from negative side effects. The long, intense concentration ends with the caster falling into a 6-hour coma.</VPE_Resurrect.description>
