    <VPE_Farskip.label>major teleport</VPE_Farskip.label>
    <VPE_Farskip.description>Connect to the planet's ley-lines to hypercharge a teleport spell, transporting the caster, along with anyone standing near them, to an ally at a distant location.

The transported people will always appear near a random ally on the target map.</VPE_Farskip.description>
