    <Genepack.description>A small bottle containing a swirling mixture. The smell is absolutely indescribable, but anyone brave enough to drink it will find their body transformed. Metamorphosis potions work by emulsifying distilled soul essenses in a solution of pure mana. When drunk the mana is absorbed in to the drinker's mana core, merging their essense together and causing the drinker's very genes to change, gaining aspects from the original entity it was distilled from.</Genepack.description>
