    <Plasteel.label>mithril</Plasteel.label>
    <Plasteel.description>A rare metal with remarkable strength, allowing it to be used to craft armor much stronger, yet far lighter than steel, allowing those lucky enough to wear it to dance around the battle field with little fear of death. It also holds an edge like few other materials making it the material of choice for blades of exceptional quality.</Plasteel.description>
