    <ResurrectionPsychosis.description>Chaotic thought patterns caused by sparks of resurrection magic still working in the body. Resurrection psychosis progresses and eventually causes total psychosis and death.\n\nResurrected people require unknowable power to rebuild their bodily functions at the cellular level. The magic always has a chance to lose stability, and if it does, uncontrolled sparks of mana wreak havoc in the central nervous system. The older the corpse, the more power is required to resurrect it, and the greater the chance of eventual decoherence.</ResurrectionPsychosis.description>
