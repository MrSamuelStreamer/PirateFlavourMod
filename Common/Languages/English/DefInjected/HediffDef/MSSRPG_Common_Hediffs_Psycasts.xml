    <PsychicAmplifier.description>Connection to a larger magical field. This allows a person to manipulate mana to influence reality in ways that seem impossible.\n\nHigher levels of magical attunement permit the use of more powers. Regardless of attunement level, a person can only use specific powers that they have learned.\n\nAttunement comes from a variety of sources. Tomes of attunement can attune a person to a higher level of magic before crumbling to dust. Tribal peoples also know how to develop a connection to the ambient magic through ritual linking with the legendary anima tree.\n\nAs a magical phenomenon, attunement is poorly-understood by researchers, not least because it seems to actively conceal itself if studied too closely. One thing most agree on is that it somehow connects people to an ambient magic field and harnesses their inner power allowing them to express their inner reserves of mana as external effects.</PsychicAmplifier.description>
